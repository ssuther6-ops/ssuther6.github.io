            <h3>Funny/Interesting Story</h3>
            <p>
                One of my most memorable learning moments was when I accidentally broke a website's layout by 
                miscalculating CSS margins. Instead of being frustrated, I used it as an opportunity to deeply 
                understand how the CSS box model works. Now, I always remember to check my calculations, and it 
                has made me a more careful and thorough developer. This experience taught me the value of 
                debugging and learning from mistakes.

            <h3>Something Else to Share</h3>
            <p>
                I believe that web development is not just about making things work—it's about making them work 
                for everyone. I am passionate about web accessibility and inclusive design. I aspire to create 
                digital experiences that are barrier-free and welcoming to all users, regardless of their abilities 
                or disabilities.
